## Digital Image Processing — Lab Exercises

This repository contains my lab work for the Digital Image Processing (DIP) course.
The first lab focuses on basic image processing tasks and helps build a clear understanding of how images are handled, manipulated, and analyzed.

### Contents

- Jupyter notebook with lab explinations and exercises

- An image from the web downloaded locally to use as an example

### Goals

- Learn how digital images are represented

- What is a pixel?

- Practice basic image operations -Image acquisition-

- Transform images into the gray scale

- Understand how to read, display, and modify images

- Apply common techniques such as filtering, thresholding, and transformations

- Resolution -Spatial and Intensity Level Resolutions-

### Tools Used

- Python

- OpenCV

- NumPy

- Jupyter Notebook

- Matplot Library

### How to Use

1. Open any lab folder

2. Run the notebook or script inside

3. Follow the steps and notes in each file

### Notes

These exercises are part of my learning process.
They show my progress in understanding the main ideas of DIP.
Including Additionals where I try to manipulate the concepts to deeply understand them!
The notebook includes disscusion questions to check understanding.
